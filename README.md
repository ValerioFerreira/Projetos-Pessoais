% accuracy# LIT Saint Paul's Data Science and Machine Learning course conclusion project 

A simple Random Forest Classifier project, developed for the conclusion of this course. 
The goal was to determine wether a costumer was going to purchase a product, based on his age, sex and estimated salary, using a Random Forest Classifier.
Also, it should display the features importances for each of those three features.

At the end, the model built had an 89% accuracy.

Note: this project was made when i was first starting to learn DS. It is simple and incomplete, but it is a tool to keep track of the evolution of my projects 
through time.
